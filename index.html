    <p id="intro"><strong>Currently an MSc Computer Science student at
      the University of Liverpool. After finishing my undergraduate degree,
      I spent lockdown refining my coding skills. In studying Maths I
      became familiar with  statistical software such as Python and R
      to analyse data sets. I recently finished work on a retro game and notes
      app; at university I look foreward to learning about algorithms, data 
      mining and E-commerce. Away from a computer I enjoy travelling, reading
      and picking up a Uke.</strong></p>

        windowcleannortheast.co.uk</a>. After 5 years of
        steady growth and pressures related to Covid-19 a website became a
        priority. I included a registration form (built using Node.js) and
        other neat features like a services map and before/after images.</p>

        </a> notes app for desktop, and later use online. I was able to create a
        simple but effective app which supports 'Note' objects but also 'Books'.
        The desktop app uses .json to store notes however I plan to transition 
        to SQL for the WebApp.</p>

        Rebels and aim to capture the 3 secret plans hidden across the galaxy by
        planning and defeating Empire armies. Each turn the Death Star will 
        destroy one of your planets. Was fun to write a relatively complex game, 
        that I and friends enjoy playing. </p>

        is a simulated stock market where the user can load stock data and
        portfolios. The automatic trading strategy 'tradeStrategy2' has been 
        extensively tested using real FTSE100 data and will always lead to an 
        (albeit small) profit.</p>
