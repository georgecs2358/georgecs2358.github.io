  <h2><u>Here are some key skills I have:</u></h2>
  <div class="flex-grid">
    <div class="skill-card">
      <div>
      <h3>Problem Solving</h3>
      <hr>
      <p>Have experience solving problems in range of fields such as managing
        dynamic pages, Mathematical logic, working with large datasets and
        developing large OOP projects.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
   <div class="skill-card">
      <div>
      <h3>Creativity</h3>
      <hr>
      <p>Third year level Maths courses require the ability to think out of the
        box and approach problems creatively. After learning Intermediate French
        and travelling Australia I learnt about different cultures and to view
        the world from a different perspective.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="skill-card">
      <div>
      <h3>Attention to Detail</h3>
      <hr>
      <p>A key part of working with large datasets in machine learning courses
        is to be aware of all seemingly miniscule data properties. Varied
        experience debugging made clear the importance of planning 
        well-structured and scaleable code to avoid a debugging nightmare.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="skill-card">
      <div>
      <h3>Dedication</h3>
      <hr>
      <p>After working hard to achieve an upper 2:1 and also working on coding
        projects outside of the classroom, I have the dedication needed to
        advance my coding skills. Whether working part-time or travelling, I am
        an individual who strives to improve in everything I do.</p>

      <h3>Teamwork</h3>
      <hr>
      <p>I have a variety of work experiences including; working as a Team
        Leader at NCS working with young people, getting to know the Manchester
        public after working in Customer Service and completing a Spring
        Internship at Deloitte. From this varied life experience the main lesson
        I learnt is that unlocking the potential of all your colleagues is the
        best path to success.</p>
